# FMU Simulator App

## Overview

The FMU Simulator App is an interactive web application that allows users to upload an FMU (Functional Mock-up Unit) file, configure the simulation parameters, and run simulations. The app leverages Panel for creating the UI, and runs simulations in a separate process to manage execution time effectively. Simulation results can be visualized and downloaded.

## Features

- Upload FMU files for simulation
- Configure simulation parameters, including duration, step size, and variable inputs
- Run simulations with controlled execution time
- Visualize simulation results as line plots
- Download simulation results as a CSV file
